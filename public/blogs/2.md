# Kubernetes 101 - An Introduction to Orchestrating Containers

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

## Why Kubernetes?

1. **Container Orchestration**: Simplifies the deployment of containers.
2. **Scalability**: Automatically scales applications based on demand.
3. **Self-Healing**: Restarts failed containers and ensures high availability.

### Core Components of Kubernetes

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit.
- **Nodes**: Machines running the Kubernetes engine.
- **Services**: Expose your application to the outside world.

Kubernetes is a powerful tool but comes with a steep learning curve. However, mastering it can unlock new levels of efficiency and scalability for your applications.
